# Process

- This project was unique in that I had never used Sveltekit previously.

- I followed the link Tony provided and discovered step-by-step instructions for configuring the Sveltekit in my VScode.

- Once I'd installed SvelteKit, I needed to locate a YouTube lesson to show me how to use it and add components, among other things.

* With Tony's excellent explanation, I was able to follow step-by-step directions on the https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog to create footer and header nav layouts that will apply to all pages on the nav tag in `src` `routes` file `layout`.

* I used Figma to develop a wireframe to illustrate how the website works so that clients could grasp it better.
